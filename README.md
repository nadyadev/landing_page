This is my landing page idea.
i have no idea what to write in the readme

i took roughly 2 hours on this, usually when i start projects i can gauge whether or not i will struggle with it.
after struggling during the flex exercises and learning alot, this landing project definitely looked easy lol.

i definitely have alot to learn 

what i struggled with was centering the text on the second part of the body. i couldnt align the box with the text but putting a margin for soem reason worked. why it worked while max-width messed it up is beyond me.

i also learnt how to be resourceful this project

anyway, hope you enjoy my landing page! thanks for stopping by.
